# NQ-ATP
Architectural Support for Accurate Massive Aggregate Queries in Data Center Networks

In our paper NQ/ATP published in IWQoS 2022, we evaluate our work using three various 
platforms: a physical **testbed**, a software **emulator** for small-scale switch-behavior 
level resource evaluation, and a **stimluator** to estimate resource usage in a large-scale 
network.

- Testbed  
We run our test on Tofino programmable switches.

- Emulator  
We rely on software switch emulator called BMv2 to emulate switch behaviors within mininets.

- Stimulator  
We further extand our evaluation using statical stimulation for large-scale estimation.

Please refer to each section for detailed explaination.
